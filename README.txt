# thesis-template-brownies
LaTeX template for (PhD) thesis

add these things:
- an introduction to this project
- based on template of vcaldas (add link)
- with Linda's help
- license (in separate file)
- I used MikTex and TexStudio (with links)
- maybe: the additional packages that are needed. Or just say that they should be installed automatically (by MikTex) upon compiling
- how to run: compile-bibliography-compile-compile
- work in progress; I'm still improving the instructions and comments; still adding more useful things
- I'm open to questions and requests
- link to my and Linda's theses for finished products
